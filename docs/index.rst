Keeping Your Garmin Forerunner 945 Maps Up to Date
==========================================

Staying current with map data improves navigation, route planning, and overall enjoyment when exploring new paths. The Forerunner 945 comes preloaded with full TopoActive maps, providing topographic details, points of interest, road and trail data. To make the most of this feature, it's crucial to perform regular map updates; here's how to do it, what to watch out for, and how to resolve common issues.

Why It Matters
TopoActive maps empower turn-by-turn guidance, terrain context, and accurate routing. Updates typically include:

New or changed trails and roads

Revised points of interest (trailheads, water sources, shelters)

Updated elevation data and terrain corrections

Without timely updates, your device might misroute you or lack new POIs—potentially causing frustration or delays.

Methods for Map Updates
You have two ways to update maps: Garmin Express (desktop) and Wi‑Fi on the watch. Garmin Express is generally faster and more reliable, especially for large map files.

Garmin Express (PC/Mac)
Install Garmin Express and pair your Forerunner 945 via USB.

The software automatically detects available updates.

Click Install under map updates.

Keep your watch connected until it completes. Note that maps are large—Europe maps can exceed 6 GB (dcrainmaker.com) 


After installation, Garmin Express will confirm update success.

Reddit reports indicate Express occasionally fails or is extremely slow (downloads at 650 KB/s), but changing DNS or restarting may help .

Wi‑Fi on the Watch
Ensure your watch is on a charger and connected to Wi‑Fi.

Go to Map Manager on the device.

Select available map updates and confirm.

The download begins, but progress may pause around 95–96% 


If stalled, cancel and retry, or switch to Garmin Express.

Managing Map Storage and Regions
The 945 offers around 16 GB of storage. Preloaded maps vary:

North America: ~5.6 GB

Europe: ~6.3 GB

Australia/NZ: ~2 GB 


To add new regions, you may need to remove unused maps via Garmin Express or manually. Note that each device includes maps specific to your purchase region—adding other regions requires manual selection or third-party maps .

Common Issues and Fixes
Download fails/stalls in Garmin Express: Ensure ~10 GB of free space, disconnect other devices, and retry. Reddit users resolved similar issues by freeing storage and reinstalling maps .

Wi-Fi stalls at 95–96%: Cancel download, reboot watch, reconnect and if persists, switch to desktop method 


Installed maps disappear or don’t appear for new regions: Reinstall via Express or use third-party OpenStreetMap maps (e.g., OpenFietsMap); manual copy via USB is supported 


Maps show “purchased” then vanish: Some regional maps (like UK/Ireland) may be removed by Garmin later, leading to loss of access despite purchase; support sometimes issues refunds .

Installing Custom Maps
Many 945 users prefer custom maps like OpenFietsMap or OpenTopoMap for more frequent OSM updates. The process:

Download .img map file (e.g., gmapsupp.img).

Connect watch via USB.

Copy the .img file into the Garmin folder on the device—do not zip 


Eject device; the map should now appear in Map Manager.

This enables you to install maps by country or region and refresh them weekly if desired.

Keeping Maps Fresh: Best Practices
Use Garmin Express regularly for updates.

Keep an eye on storage capacity, removing unused regions.

If Wi‑Fi updates fail, fall back to desktop method.

Back up important maps before manually editing or switching.

Consider third-party maps for more up-to-date or detailed data.

Garmin releases map updates several times per year, so check every few months or before major trips 

Final Take
Updating maps on your Forerunner 945 maintains its rich navigational features, ensuring accurate routes and detailed terrain data. While Garmin Express offers speed and reliability, Wi‑Fi updates provide convenience—just be ready with backup options when downloads stall. For even greater control, explore custom map files designed to meet your specific needs. With the right approach, your watch remains a trusted navigation companion wherever your adventures take you.
